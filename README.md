## Project Overview

This repository contains multiple hands-on networking and security lab projects 
designed to practice enterprise network concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The labs focus on the following areas:

### 🔹 Network Segmentation & VLAN Design
- VLAN-based network separation (Personnel, Management, Guest, Servers)
- Access & Trunk port configuration
- Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick, Multilayer Switch)

### 🔹 Routing & IP Services
- Static routing and default gateways
- DHCP server and DHCP relay (ip helper-address)
- Subnet planning and IP addressing

### 🔹 Wireless Network Architecture
- Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) & Lightweight Access Points (LAP)
- SSID to VLAN mapping
- Secure management VLAN design

### 🔹 Security & Management Concepts
- Port security configurations
- Management VLAN isolation
- Centralized services (DNS, DHCP, Syslog, AAA)
